## Summary Assessment

Are you ready to put your skills to the test and have some full stack hacking fun? This assessment will be like a day-long solo sprint where you get use the skills and technologies you have worked with during the first half of the course. You should expect to revisit concepts and techniques you are familiar with while learning some new content as well.

### Don'ts

- Don't wait until the end to commit all your work

### Dos

- Do commit frequently
- Do use Google, MDN, Stack Overflow, documentation, etc. to support you in your work
- Do use help desk if you have any issues with the codebase or your dev environment
- Do use help desk if you have any clarifying questions
- Do use help desk should you need an exception to any of the above
- Do check your email or Slack periodically for any important announcements from staff

### Setup

Do the following before beginning:

- Clone this repo. (There is no need to fork because you will not be submitting your work through this repository.)

### Guidelines

There are 4 prompts in this assessment, each in its own directory. Each prompt contains its own `README.md` with instructions. The prompts can be worked on in any order.

You will need to manage your time effectively to complete all of the prompts. Be absolutely certain to do at least some significant work on each prompt. Even if you do not complete a prompt, you should provide sufficient comments and/or pseudocode to explain your ideas and intent regarding the prompt.

These prompts will be evaluated as if they were coding challenges given to you as part of a job application process. Not only will the functionality of your code be important, but also, the professionalism with which you write it. Consider the style and organization of your code. Make frequent commits with informative and consistent commit messages. Be professional and informative with your comments.

While you should make frequent commits, do not push your work! When you have completed your work, follow the submission [instructions below](#submission).

### Prompts

- back-end
- bare-node-graph
- front-end
- rest-api

Look at the `README.md` file in each of the prompt's directories for detailed instructions. Be sure to run `npm install` inside each directory.

### Submission

Your work will be submitted with the help of a script located in the root directory of this repo. After completing your work, fill out the `closing_comments` file in this directory. Then, run the script, following its instructions closely:

```
bash submit.sh
```
